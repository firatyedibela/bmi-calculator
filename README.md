## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Programming Language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com) Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - For Styles
- [Motion](https://motion.dev/docs/react-motion-component) - Animation library

### What I learned

- Observing form values in real-time using watch API of the React Hook Form to dynamically respond to user input and make calculations with form data without requiring an explicit form submission.
- Conditionally rendering different form fields based on the values of other fields by using the watch API from React Hook Form.
